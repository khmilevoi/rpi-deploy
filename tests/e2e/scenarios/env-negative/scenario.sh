# Environment-overlays spec, negative paths. Local overlay resolution must
# fail before any agent contact for: a missing overlay file (with a hint
# listing the overlays that do exist), an invalid or reserved --env name,
# --vars misuse (without --env, or against a non-parameterized overlay), an
# on_create command absent from the merged [commands], an overlay silently
# inheriting the base [ingress].hostname (production-route hijack), and a
# base rpi.toml whose project name contains the reserved '--'. Agent-side:
# `rpi env reset-data` of a nonexistent environment is a genuine error
# (unlike destroy, which is idempotent), and a deploy whose on_create exits
# nonzero fails at the on_create stage while keeping on_create_done false —
# the registered key survives and the next deploy retries the command.
